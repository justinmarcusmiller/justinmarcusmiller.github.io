    	<p>During my spring break I mostly spent time with my family and did work around the house. During the first part of break, I helped my grandfather install tile in the house he is building. Later in the week, I put up a fence at my house and improved my chicken coop. I had a fun spring break, but I am also glad to be back in school.</p>
